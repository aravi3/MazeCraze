MazeCraze is an algorithm visualization tool for solving mazes. It uses different
tree traversal methods to present the visualization.

## Features & Implementation

### Random Maze Generation

### Different Tree Traversal Solutions

### Efficiency Calculations

## Future Directions for the Project

The following 2 features are next steps
for MazeCraze:

### Visual Representation of Efficiency Calculations

I plan to use D3.js to graph the execution time, visited nodes, and efficiency
for each tree traversal methods at different grid sizes.

### More Tree Traversal Solutions

I plan to research and implement further tree traversal solutions.
